# Dex

{% hint style="info" %}
A Dex is short for a Decentralised Exchange. The Rebase Dex gives you over $55 billion of liquidity to trade assets.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

When using the Dex, you can trade over 3 chains:&#x20;

* ETH&#x20;
* Binance Smart Chain&#x20;
* Polygon&#x20;

Simply choose the asset you want to swap from and to. To search for an asset out of the 200+ available assets press **`ctrl "F"`** and type the asset name.&#x20;

Once you have chosen your desired asset select swap and confirm the transaction when the Metamask notification appears.&#x20;

Once the transaction has been confirmed in the blockchain (usually a couple seconds) the asset will appear in your Metamask account.&#x20;
