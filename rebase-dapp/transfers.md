# Transfers

Transfers will show the history of every movement of money done between networks, the value of those transfers and it will give you a TX Hash for each transfer done.

Under the Token heading, an address will be recorded.  This address allows Metamask to know exactly which coin is being used in the transfer. It is like a coin ID address.
